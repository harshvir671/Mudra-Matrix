# Mudra-Matrix
Project Mudra Matrix is a deep learning–based system that detects and classifies hand mudras from images or video. Using computer vision and neural networks, it identifies finger positions and gestures in real time, enabling applications in dance training, cultural preservation, and gesture-based interaction.

Mudra Matrix

Project Mudra Matrix is an AI-driven system designed to automatically recognize, classify, and interpret mudras (hand gestures commonly used in classical dance, yoga, and meditation) using deep learning. The project combines computer vision, gesture-recognition algorithms, and neural networks to create a robust framework for understanding subtle hand positions and movements in real time.

At the core of Mudra Matrix is a deep learning model—typically a convolutional neural network (CNN), 3D-CNN, or a transformer-based vision model—trained on annotated images or video sequences of various mudras. The system processes visual input, identifies key hand landmarks or skeletal points, and predicts the corresponding mudra label with high accuracy. By leveraging techniques like pose estimation, temporal modeling, and data augmentation, the project ensures reliable performance even under varying lighting, backgrounds, or camera angles.

Key Features

Automated Mudra Detection: Recognizes static and dynamic mudras from images or live video feed.

Hand Pose Estimation: Uses landmark detection to understand finger positions and joint orientations.

Deep Learning-Based Classification: Learns subtle differences between visually similar mudras.

Real-Time Feedback: Provides instant recognition results for interactive applications.

Scalability: Easily add new mudras or gesture sets through retraining or fine-tuning.

Applications

Digital training tools for classical dance learners (e.g., Bharatanatyam, Kathak)

Yoga and mindfulness apps that detect and correct hand positions

Cultural preservation and documentation

Gesture-based human–computer interaction systems

Educational tools for teaching symbolic hand gestures
