# Mudra-Matrix
Project Mudra Matrix is a deep learning–based system that detects and classifies hand mudras from images or video. Using computer vision and neural networks, it identifies finger positions and gestures in real time, enabling applications in dance training, cultural preservation, and gesture-based interaction.
